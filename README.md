# Algovera Creations

This space contains datasets, algorithms and apps created by the Algovera community. In future, the Algovera [deHub](https://github.com/AlgoveraAI/deHub) library will be used to instantiate and modify creations, as well as automically publish creations to a variety of platforms including the [Ocean Marketplace](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and ActiveLoop [Hub](https://app.activeloop.ai/).
