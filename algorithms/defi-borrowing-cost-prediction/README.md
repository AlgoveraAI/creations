# üí∏ Algovera: Machine learning for predicting the borrowing cost across different DeFi protocols

Is it possible to use machine learning to predict the borrowing cost across different DeFi protocols? It would be useful to be able to present the best borrowing and lending opportunities in DeFi, as well as show predictions of how that market will behave in the future. The main goal of this strategy is to capture the yield given out by the protocol without taking exposure to liquidation risk or too much market exposure. Any processed datasets, results/analysis and algorithms developed will be published on Ocean [marketplace](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/), with the hope of helping DeFi investors make better decisions using quality information. The scope of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VwuIonYWP8IJ7tfUtJJwxDRyagPMeqrAfVhg80rcrU/edit).
