    "The 3-C2D-flow-ocean notebook provides a good first step towards getting your head around C2D, but it is not configured to the C2D flow data scientists might use when training an ML model. In this notebook and those that follow, we'll work on the same steps but this time specifically for the Cryptopunks generative art project. The steps are separated for modularity and to provide a template that can be used in subsequent projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes from the original C2D Notebook:\n",
    "- **3. Alice publishes a dataset** is not needed here (this is relevant for teams who want to publish datasets, not teams who want to use existing datasets to train ML models)\n",
    "- **4. Alice publishes an algorithm** is relevant (we're going to publish the ML model as an algorithm)\n",
    "- **5. Bob acquires datatokens for data and algorithm** is only needed to get the datatokens for the data (we already own the tokens for the algorithm)\n",
    "- **6. Bob starts a compute job** is relevant (we need to specify where we want to train the algorithm on. Initially, the simplest option is connecting to an AWS compute instance, later on to decentralized computer providers such as the Raven Protocol)\n",
    "- **7. Bob monitors logs / algorithm output** is relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional steps not covered in C2D Notebook:\n",
    "- testing the trained model\n",
    "- running inference\n",
    "- retraining the model (after change of architecture/hyperparameter tuning)\n",
    "- publishing the trained model on the marketplace\n",
    "- using the model from the marketplace to get a new Cryptopunk"

At the moment, most artists train their models off-chain, with only the outputs of the models  published on-chain as NFTs. By publishing datasets and algorithms on the Ocean marketplace, NFT enthusiasts could also buy or provide liquidity for the algorithm and data tokens. The aim of this algorithm is to demonstrate how artists can unlock more value by publishing their models on Ocean. Read more in [this](https://medium.com/@richardblythman/unlocking-more-value-for-nft-enthusiasts-by-bringing-access-to-generative-art-algorithms-on-chain-5f3957bc7953) blog post.\\n\\n### HuggingFace Gradio App\\n\\nThis algorithm runs inference of a pre-trained generative model on a random noise vector. It is used to demonstrate a Proof of Concept of a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)  app that serves an algorithm from the Ocean marketplace in the backend. You can view the app on HuggingFace Spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlgoveraAI/dcgan-crypto-punks).
